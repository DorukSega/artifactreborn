## Artifact Reborn

We're doing this project for a few reasons; proving that a fun version of Artifact can be made, providing commmunity open source tools they can use to make their own versions (with highly modifiable puzzle/mod maker), and because it's a lot of fun.

### Roadmap plans

A comprehensive and engaging 3 lanes mode. To begin with 1 deck vs AI.
  - biweekly puzzles with prizes to promote the project
  - adding more cards to the game
  - simple deckbuilder with export/import codes
  
Multiplayer, starting on 2 lanes mode as well as doing a small expansion for both modes (maybe 1 new color).

Doing general GUI puzzle/mod support mode with a lot of options, as well a card maker.

Long term: switching to [Vue-Phaser framework](https://github.com/Rtificer/Artifact-Reborn).
Gameplay with real-time events (not purely turn-based). 6 colors.
