## What is Artifact Reborn?

Artifact Reborn is an open source, non-profit, fan creation of [Artifact](https://playartifact.com/). 
Started after Artifact Foundry's [end of development](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/583950/view/3047218819080842820), it's a fan passion project. 
Its goal is to provide a moddable, expandable or even improvable alternative to previous Artifact games.

We're doing this project for a few reasons; proving that a fun version of Artifact can be made, providing commmunity open source tools they can use to make their own versions (with highly modifiable puzzle/mod maker), and because it's a lot of fun.


### Roadmap plans

  - A comprehensive and engaging 3 lane mode. To begin with as 1 deck vs AI.
  - Multiplayer implementation (Matchmaking).
  - Biweekly puzzles with prizes to promote the project and a puzzle maker to make your own.
  - A leaderboard and unlockable cosmetics based on levels or xp.
  - Adding more cards to the game by commissioning independent artists.
  - Simple deckbuilder with ability to export/import decks, including from Artifact Foundry.
  - Doing general GUI puzzle/mod support mode with a lot of options, as well a card maker and a way to easily get a print ready version of cards.
  - 3 lane mode that is more close to Foundry or exactly same.
  - A 2 lane mode for more casual play.
