## What is Artifact Reborn?

Artifact Reborn is a open source, non profit, fan creation of [the Artifact](https://playartifact.com/). 
Started after The Artifact Foundry's [end of development](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/583950/view/3047218819080842820), it is fan passion project. 
It's goal is to provide a moddable, expandable or even improveable alternative to the Artifact Foundry. 

We're doing this project for a few reasons; proving that a fun version of Artifact can be made, providing commmunity open source tools they can use to make their own versions (with highly modifiable puzzle/mod maker), and because it's a lot of fun.


### Roadmap plans

  - A comprehensive and engaging 3 lanes mode. Firstly as 1 deck vs AI.
  - Multiplayer implementation (Matchmaking).
  - Biweekly puzzles with prizes to promote the project and a puzzle maker to make your own.
  - A leadboard and unlockable cosmetics based on levels or xp
  - adding more cards to the game by commisioning independent artists.
  - simple deckbuilder with ability to export/import decks from Artifact Foundry
  - Doing general GUI puzzle/mod support mode with a lot of options, as well a card maker and a way to easly get a print ready version of cards.
  - 3 lane mode that is more close to Foundry or exactly same.
  - A 2 lane casual targeted mode.
