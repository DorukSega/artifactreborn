MOST OF THE RULES:

UPDATED AND ADDITIONAL RULES:

- Day and Night cycle every round. Draw 2 cards day, 1 night.

- Hero signature cards have additional "Bond" abilities that only triggers while their owner is in play/in that lane/is the caster. Can now include 1-2 signature cards (at least 1).

- Tower HP to 60, stats increased accordingly; maybe: armor a compromise between 1.0 and 2.0 (degrades by 1 with each damage instance(source)). maybe: Ancient HP 90.

- Tower Enchantments now called Lane Enchantments and can both affect the whole lane or nearest slot(s) (so be consious where you play them!).

- After an enemy Tower is destroyed, instead of a Melee Creep (2 2), a Mega Creep (4 4) will start spawning for you in that lane (always, and taking priority over other rules).
(likely: only 1 Melee Creep will spawn for the side in the lane that has fewest units. 1 will spawn for both sides if equal number of units and if the lane is empty (equal); 
important for hero deployment; can only deploy heroes/units near allies or opposite of enemies.)
(likely: all Melee Creeps become Mega Creeps and get +2 +2 for the Night duration. if a Mega Creep has 2 or less health at round end, it dies)
