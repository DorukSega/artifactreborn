MOST OF THE RULES:
https://telegra.ph/Artifact-is-dead-long-live-Artifact-Reborn-03-13


ADDITIONAL RULES:

- Day and Night cycle every round. Draw 2 cards day, 1 night.

- After an enemy Tower is destroyed, instead of a Melee Creep (2 2), a Mega Creep (4 4) will start spawning for you in that lane. 
(likely: all Melee Creeps become Mega Creeps and get +2 +2 for the Night duration)

- Hero signature cards have additional "Bond" abilities that only triggers while their owner is in play/in that lane/is the caster.

- Tower HP to 60, stats increased accordingly, armor back to how it worked in 1.0. (maybe: Ancient HP 90)

- Tower Enchantments now called Lane Enchantments and can both affect the whole lane or nearest slot(s) (so be consious where you play them!).
